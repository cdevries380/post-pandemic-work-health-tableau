# Post-Pandemic Work Health (Tableau Project)
This project explores the relationship between work arrangements (remote, hybrid, onsite) and employee well-being using survey data.

## Key Questions
1. How do mental health outcomes differ across work arrangements?
2. What is the relationship between work-life balance, burnout, and hours worked?
3. How do demographic and salary differences shape health impacts?
