Employee Burnout and Social Isolation Analysis by Work Arrangement
Ask

The goal of this project is to understand how burnout levels and social isolation scores vary by work arrangement (remote, hybrid, on-site).

This project focuses on two contrasting contexts:

Remote-friendly context: Technical / Specialist roles in Technology and Professional Services

On-site-friendly context: Customer-Facing / Support roles in Healthcare and Retail

The purpose of the experiments is to determine whether remote workers consistently experience higher burnout and isolation, and how industry and role type influence these outcomes.

Prepare

The dataset contains survey responses with demographics, industry, job role, work arrangement, burnout level (Low / Medium / High), and social isolation score.

Key preparation steps included:

Grouped job roles into four categories: Technical / Specialist, Customer-Facing / Support, Marketing / Content, and Management / Leadership. Grouping reduced complexity and highlighted meaningful differences between types of work.

Selected relevant industries for each experiment to isolate contexts where remote or on-site work is naturally more suitable.

Calculated burnout percentages per category instead of averages, because averages masked the distribution of low, medium, and high burnout responses.

Process

Before isolating specific industries or job roles, the dataset was visualized as a whole to observe general trends:

Burnout: Remote workers generally reported higher high-burnout percentages than hybrid or on-site workers. On-site workers consistently had the highest proportion of low-burnout responses.

Social Isolation: Remote workers had the highest average scores, hybrid workers were intermediate, and on-site workers had the lowest scores.

These baseline observations motivated the experiments, which compared two contrasting contexts to see if the pattern holds across different types of work.

Filters:

Industry filter: to select relevant industries for each experiment.

Job Role filter: four grouped categories to simplify analysis and focus on meaningful patterns.

Experiment 1 — Technical / Specialist in Technology + Professional Services

Remote workers had the highest high-burnout percentages, hybrid moderate, on-site lowest.

Social isolation followed the same pattern: remote highest, hybrid middle, on-site lowest.

Experiment 2 — Customer-Facing / Support in Healthcare + Retail

Remote workers again had the highest high-burnout percentages, hybrid moderate, on-site lowest. On-site workers had a larger proportion reporting low burnout than in Experiment 1.

Social isolation followed the same gradient: remote highest, hybrid middle, on-site lowest.

Analyze

Across both experiments, a consistent pattern emerged: remote workers experience the highest burnout and social isolation, hybrid workers are moderate, and on-site workers report the lowest levels.

Remote-friendly context: Remote workers in Technical / Specialist roles within Technology and Professional Services still experienced elevated burnout and isolation.

On-site-friendly context: On-site workers in Customer-Facing / Support roles within Healthcare and Retail had a higher proportion of low-burnout responses.

These experiments demonstrate that while remote work generally increases burnout and isolation, the severity is influenced by role type and industry.

Using percentages for burnout rather than averages was critical to accurately capture the distribution of experiences.

The baseline trends observed in the whole dataset were reflected in both experiments, confirming that the remote > hybrid > on-site gradient is robust across contexts.

Share / Act

Offer hybrid work options to reduce burnout and isolation for remote employees.

Provide structured social support and check-ins for remote workers, especially in technical roles.

Monitor high-contact on-site roles to ensure employee wellbeing is maintained.

The dashboard visualizes burnout percentages and social isolation scores by work arrangement, helping stakeholders identify at-risk groups and implement interventions.
