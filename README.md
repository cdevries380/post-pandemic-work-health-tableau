# Post-Pandemic Work Health (Tableau Project)

This project explores the relationship between work arrangements (**remote**, **hybrid**, **onsite**) and employee well-being using survey data.

## 🧠 Key Questions

1. How do mental health outcomes differ across work arrangements?  
2. What is the relationship between work-life balance, burnout, and hours worked?  
3. How do demographic and salary differences shape health impacts?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset was mostly clean, but I conducted a thorough inspection to confirm data quality and consistency before analysis.

### **Steps Taken**
- **Checked for missing values** using filters and conditional formulas.  
- **Verified categorical consistency** (ensuring “Remote,” “Hybrid,” and “Onsite” were entered uniformly).  
- **Tested for extra spaces or hidden characters** using the `TRIM()` and `CLEAN()` functions.  
- **Confirmed data types** for numerical and date fields to support accurate analysis in Tableau.  
- **Reviewed duplicates** to ensure each record represented a unique response.  

Overall, the dataset required **minimal cleaning**, with only light formatting adjustments before visualization.
